==========

For the most part this project is 95% clutter since I just committed the entire themeforest folder.

Most of the files in here aren't used right now.  The only ones needed are:

* index.html
* rsvp.html
* images folder

The carousel images are in `images/slider` and the profile pics are in `images/profile`.  The Turtle Bay logos are in `images/bottombar`

There is some StackMob logic in the RSVP page, using StackMob's JS SDK.  Right now it's pretty simplistic in that it just saves all the RSVP information into the user object and persists it to the server.  The logic can be found at `js/app.js`.
